/**
 * Time is referenced by a temporal reference system (temporal RS). In the current
 * version of this Community Standard, only a string-based notation for time
 * values is defined. Future versions of this Community Standard may allow for
 * alternative notations, such as recording time values as numeric offsets from
 * a given temporal datum (e.g. “days since 1970-01-01”).
 *
 * If the calendar is based on years, months, days, then the referenced values
 * SHOULD use one of the following ISO8601-based lexical representations:
 * YYYY
 * ±XYYYY (where X stands for extra year digits)
 * YYYY-MM
 * YYYY-MM-DD
 * YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS[.F]Z where Z is either “Z” or a time scale offset +|-HH:MM
 *
 * If calendar dates with reduced precision are used in a lexical representation
 * (e.g. "2016"), then a client SHOULD interpret those dates in that reduced precision.
 *
 * If "type" is "TemporalRS" and "calendar" is "Gregorian", then the above lexical
 * representation MUST be used.
