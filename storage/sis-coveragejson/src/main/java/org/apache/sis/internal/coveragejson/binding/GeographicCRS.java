/**
 * Geographic CRSs anchor coordinate values to an ellipsoidal approximation of
 * the Earth. They have coordinate axes of geodetic longitude and geodetic
 * latitude, and perhaps height above the ellipsoid (i.e. they can be two- or three-dimensional).
 * The origin of the CRS is on the surface of the ellipsoid.
 *
 * Note that sometimes (e.g. for numerical model data) the exact CRS may not be
 * known or may be undefined. In this case the "id" may be omitted, but the "type"
 * still indicates that this is a geographic CRS. Therefore clients can still use
 * geodetic longitude, geodetic latitude (and maybe height) axes, even if they
 * cannot accurately georeference the information.
 * If a Coverage conforms to one of the defined domain types then the coordinate
 * identifier "x" is used to denote geodetic longitude, "y" is used for geodetic
 * latitude and "z" for ellipsoidal height.
