/**
 * A CoverageJSON object with the type "NdArray" is an NdArray object.
 * It represents a multidimensional (>= 0D) array with named axes, encoded as a
 * flat, one-dimensional JSON array in row-major order.
 *
 * Note that common JSON implementations use IEEE 754-2008 64-bit
 * (double precision) floating point numbers as the data type for "values". Users
 * SHOULD be aware of the limitations in precision when encoding numbers in this way.
 * For example, when encoding integers, users SHOULD be aware that only values
 * within the range [-253+1, 253-1] can be represented in a way that will ensure
 * exact interoperability among such implementations [IETF RFC 7159].
