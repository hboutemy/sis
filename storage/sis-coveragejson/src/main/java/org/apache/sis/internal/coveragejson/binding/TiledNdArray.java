/**
 * A CoverageJSON object with the type "TiledNdArray" is a TiledNdArray object.
 * It represents a multidimensional (>= 1D) array with named axes that is split
 * up into sets of linked NdArray documents. Each tileset typically covers a
 * specific data access scenario, for example, loading a single time slice of a
 * grid vs. loading a time series of a spatial subset of a grid.
