 * Differences from OGC Simple Feature Access :
 * <ul>
 *  <li>SRID : replaced by getCoordinateReferenceSystem</li>
 *  <li>is3D : look at geometry CoordinateReferenceSystem instead</li>
 *  <li>isMeasured() :
 *      SFA defines only a single measure attribute attached to the geometry.
 *      Khronos/GPU geometries may defined multiple and complex attributes.

 *  <li>spatial and relation methods : found on GeometryOperations.</li>
