/**
 * A CoverageJSON document can be extended with custom members and types in a
 * robust and interoperable way. For that, it makes use of absolute URIs and
 * compact URIs (prefix:suffix) in order to avoid conflicts with other extensions
 * and future versions of the format. A central registry of compact URI prefixes
 * is provided which anyone can extend and which is a simple mapping from compact
 * URI prefix to namespace URI in order to avoid collisions with other extensions
 * that are based on compact URIs as well. Extensions that do not follow this
 * approach MAY use simple names instead of absolute or compact URIs but have to
 * accept the consequence of the document being less interoperable and future-proof.
 * In certain use cases this is not an issue and may be a preferred solution for
 * simplicity reasons, for example, if such CoverageJSON documents are only used
 * internally and are not meant to be shared to a wider audience.
